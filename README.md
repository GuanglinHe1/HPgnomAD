## P1 Helicobacter pylori Pipeline

This directory collects the scripts and configuration files used for the P1 *Helicobacter pylori* analyses. Each numbered subfolder contains one processing module (e.g., whole-genome sequencing, GWAS, dN/dS, comparative genomics). Refer to the `request.md` file for current editing guidelines across scripts. When running any workflow, execute commands from within this project to keep all relative paths valid, and review each module’s `script` or `conf` subdirectories for detailed usage notes.
